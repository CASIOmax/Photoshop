# Working with Artboards, Color Modes, and Image Resolutions in Photoshop

## Artboards in Photoshop

You can utilize **multiple artboards** within a single file to manage different designs simultaneously. Here's how to work with artboards:

- Use the **Artboard Move Tool** to move between and organize artboards.
- If you convert an image to **Smart Objects** and duplicate it across several layers, any changes made to the **Smart Object** will automatically be reflected across all instances of that object in your file.

**Tip**: Clicking on the small **Smart Object** icon on one of the duplicated layers will open it in a new tab. Any changes you make there will affect all instances of the smart object in the original file.

## RGB vs. CMYK Color Modes

- **RGB** (Red, Green, Blue): Primarily used for screens, monitors, and digital designs. It offers a broad color range.
- **CMYK** (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black): Used for printing purposes. The color range is more limited than RGB, but it's crucial for producing accurate printed colors.

**Important**: 
- When converting from **RGB to CMYK**, go to **Image > Mode > CMYK Color**. Once converted to CMYK, the process is irreversible, so it's a one-way conversion.
- Always save an **RGB** backup file if you plan to work with both formats. This ensures you can go back and make adjustments for digital use.

**Tip**: You can also ask your printer to handle the conversion process to **CMYK** for better accuracy.

## Changing Image Resolution

When designing for print or digital, adjusting resolution is important for clarity and quality:

- For high-quality print designs, you typically need **300 DPI** (dots per inch). For web and screen designs, **72 DPI** is standard.
- To adjust the resolution, go to **Image > Image Size** and configure the **DPI** and dimensions.
