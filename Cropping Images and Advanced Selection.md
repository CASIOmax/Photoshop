# Cropping Images and Advanced Selection in Photoshop

This document outlines how to crop images, make selections, work with clipping masks, and adjust shadows in Photoshop, including handy shortcuts and tips.

## Cropping Images

- **Hold Shift**: Crop proportionally.
- **Delete Cropped Pixels**: Ensure this option is turned **off** if you want to keep cropped parts for future edits.
- **Content-Aware Cropping**: Want to expand an image? Use the **Crop Tool** and turn on **Content Aware** to intelligently fill in the expanded area.
- **Straighten Lines**: Use the **Straighten** option in the Crop Tool to align horizontal lines.

## Selecting and Copying Images or Parts of Images

- Use the **Marquee Tool** to select and copy parts of an image and transfer them between layers or files.

## Clipping Masks

1. Write some text.
2. Move the background layer **above** the text layer.
3. Use the shortcut **Alt + Ctrl + G** (Windows) or **Option + Command + G** (Mac) to apply the clipping mask. The background will now fill the text.
4. You can move the background image within the text for positioning.

**Resource**: Find cool fonts at [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/).

## Quick Selection

- **Quick Selection Tool Shortcut**: `W`
- **Increase Brush Size**: `]`
- **Decrease Brush Size**: `[`
- **Alt + Right-click (Windows)** or **Control + Option (Mac)**, then drag left or right to change brush size.

## Inversing Selections

To **inverse your selection**:
1. Go to **Select** > **Inverse**.  
   This will invert your selection, so the background is selected instead of the object.

## Adjusting Levels and Drop Shadows

If you're copying and pasting an object from one image to another and want to adjust **levels** without affecting the background:

1. Add a **Levels Adjustment Layer**.
2. In the Adjustment Panel, click the **Clipping Mask icon** (a rectangle with an arrow) to apply the levels to only the selected layer.

---

## Putting Text Behind an Image

1. **Cut and paste** the object you want to be in front.
2. Make two layers with the object.
3. Insert your **text** between the two layers, placing it behind the object.

---

## Layer Masking

1. **Select an area** in the image.
2. In the **Layers Panel**, click the **Layer Mask icon** (a camera symbol next to the fx button).
3. This will remove the background of the selection.
4. Adjust the **feather** to blend the object smoothly into a new background.
5. To move the mask and image separately, unlink them in the **Layers Panel**.

## Adding Shadows

- Use the **Burn Tool** to add shadows or increase darkness in areas of your image.
- **Toggle** between the **Dodge Tool** (to lighten) and the **Burn Tool** (to darken).
