This file provides detailed instructions and tips on using **Shapes**, **Paths**, and **Text** in Photoshop, including solutions to common issues.

## Shapes

### Selecting Shapes
- To access different shapes (Rectangle, Circle, etc.):
  1. **Hold** the shape tool on the left toolbar.
  2. A list of shape options will appear. **Drag** to the shape you want to select.

### Editing Shapes After Creation
- If you create a shape and switch to the **Move Tool**, you may notice that options like **Stroke**, **Fill**, etc., don't appear when you click the shape again.
  - **Fix**: First, select the shape from the **Layers Panel**, and then select the **Shape Tool** to access its editing options.

### Path vs. Shapes
- **Paths** and **Shapes** are different. If a shape doesn’t appear after drawing, check the top left corner and ensure you’ve selected **Shape** rather than **Path**.
  
### Common Questions:
- **The shape is not appearing?**  
  Check if **Path** is selected instead of **Shape** in the top left corner.
  
- **I am unable to edit the shapes?**  
  Select the shape from the **Layers Panel** first, then click on the **Shape Tool** to enable editing.

### Customizing Shapes
- You can change a shape’s appearance, like turning a **star** into other variations:
  1. Draw the shape.
  2. In the **top bar settings**, adjust the **Intent** slider to increase or decrease the star’s points or change the shape.

- **Custom Shapes**: Photoshop also offers **pre-built shapes**. To access them, select the **Custom Shape Tool** and use the top bar to choose from a library of pre-designed shapes.

### Common Questions:
- **How can I change a star into different shapes?**  
  Adjust the **Intent** in the shape settings to alter its appearance.

- **How can I use Adobe’s pre-built shapes?**  
  Select the **Custom Shape Tool**, and from the top bar, choose a pre-built shape.

## Text

### Adding Effects to Text
- To give text cool effects, type your text and then:
  1. In the **top navigation bar**, click the **T** with a curve (Wrap Text).
  2. You can select a variety of text styles and effects.

## Paths

### Using Paths
- You can create a **Path** using either a **Shape** or the **Pen Tool**:
  1. Select the **Shape Tool** or **Pen Tool**.
  2. Switch the mode from **Shape** to **Path** in the top left corner.
  3. Draw the path on the canvas.

### Adding Text to a Path
- After creating a path, you can add text that follows the path’s contour:
  1. Use the **Text Tool** and click on the path to start typing along it.
  2. Adjust text alignment by hovering over the path until a **black arrow** appears. This allows you to move the text along the path.

### Common Questions:
- **How to use paths?**  
  Select **Path** mode using the shape or pen tool, then draw the path and add text to it.
