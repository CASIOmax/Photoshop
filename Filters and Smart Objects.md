# Filters and Smart Objects

This document covers essential filter applications, the use of smart objects, and tips for enhancing your designs in Photoshop.

## Filters

To apply filters:
1. Go to the **Filter** menu.
2. Optionally, select **Convert for Smart Filters** to preserve the original layer.

### Blur Filter

You can use the **Blur** filter to add depth to your images. For example:
- **Clip** an object, then blur the background to simulate motion and create a sense of speed.

### Adding Flares

You can add flares to your design by using the **Lens Flare** filter in the Filter menu. This effect simulates light reflections on a lens, enhancing realism.

## Smart Objects

### Why Use Smart Objects?

One issue in Photoshop is that when you **scale down** an image and then scale it back up, the quality decreases. Smart Objects solve this problem by preserving the image quality, no matter how much you resize it.

- **Convert to Smart Object**: Right-click the layer and select *Convert to Smart Object* to protect the quality.
- **File Size**: Be mindful that Smart Objects increase the file size compared to regular layers.
- **Rasterizing**: If you want to convert it back to a regular layer, simply **Rasterize the Layer**.

### Smart Objects vs. Vector Objects

- **Smart Objects** are pixel-based images that retain quality when scaled but increase file size.
- **Vector Objects** (usually created in Illustrator) are coordinate-based, meaning they can be scaled infinitely without losing quality. Vectors are best for logos, icons, and any artwork that needs to be resized frequently.

## Blending Images and Elements

To bend or manipulate images:
1. Go to **Edit > Transform** for options like **Distort** and **Warp**.
2. For blending effects, change the layer's **Blending Mode** in the Layers panel to modes like **Dissolve**, **Linear Light**, or others to create various effects.

## Creating a Drippy Text Effect

For a drippy text effect, follow these steps:
1. Use **Clipping Masks** to clip the text to an image or layer.
2. Apply the **Liquify Filter** to distort the edges and create a dripping effect.
3. Add **Bevel and Emboss** to give the text a 3D look.
